### Hi, I'm Andrew

- I've been programming seriously for ~6 years, first in JavaScript and then (preferrably) in C.
- I have also worked with Go, Python, TypeScript, C# (rough order of experience)
- Programming has (so far) not been my job, but I have used it in my professional work.
- ~7 years of experience in training, instructional design, and technical writing in a variety of engineering domains.
